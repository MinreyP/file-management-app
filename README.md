# File Management App
### Built with React and Zustand
Having been intimidated by Redux's complexity and the amount of boiler codes required to set it up, I was drawn to Zustand. After browsing through its documentation, I was truly amazed by its simplicity and decided to build a file management project to get the hang of it.

#### File Management App Features
- Users can right-click on a folder or file item to bring out its available actions in the edit menu.
- There's a root folder initially, and it can only be renamed. Deletion or other actions are not allowed.
- You can add, copy, cut, paste, delete or rename a folder or a file.
- There's a file preview feature on the right-side of the screen when the user clicks a file.
- Users can search files by name using the search bar.
- All Latest edits will be stored in the local storage.

Clone the repo and `npm run dev` to browse the project
